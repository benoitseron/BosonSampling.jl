fix lossless cases (to improve speed)
repartition in partition of experimental samples
go in a new branch
find some theoretical partition TVD (fixing the unitary)
separate the lossy part when outputting and event of a ModeOccupation, at least for the printing and count for the TVD
update tutorials?
can we get estimates about loss without lossy simulations?
can I accelerate stuff by multiprocessing?
