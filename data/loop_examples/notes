The current experiment is with
n = 3
m = 6

In the distinguishable case:

In the first file you have the counts in each output mode when sending photons in the input mode #1,
in the second the counts in each output mode when sending photons in the input mode #3,
and in the third  the same when sending photons in the input mode #5.
I kept them separated because I don't know how you plan to sum up single photon events to find an equivalent n-photon one.
